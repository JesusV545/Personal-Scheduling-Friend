# Personal-Scheduling-Friend

## Description
Ever had trouble keeping up with daily tasks and time management? Well, this web application is the optimal solution. With this app, the user is allowed to plan
out their day from 6 AM to 6 PM with a handy live time tracker as well. Time blocks allow the user to input any text and save it to their local storage for later use. There is also a color coating feature that makes the schedule easier to understanc. For instance, grey-shaded blocks represent the past, red-shaded blocks represent the present, and green-shaded blocks represent the future. 

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to practice using third party APIs such as bootstrap, jquery, and Day.js. Using these third party APIs, it allows the developer to code more efficiently by cutting multiple lines of hard-to-read-code into more compact and clean lines of code. 

## How to Use
To use this application, the user must simply type text desired time blocks. Once the user has finished typing their text, the save button must be clicked to save to their local storage. This allows the text data to be saved and is able to be accessed at a later time.
